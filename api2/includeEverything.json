Gwynne, who currently lives with her stepson in South Carolina, is selling these photos via RR Auction to raise money for her stepson’s tuition fee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharing a picture of Musk as a 23-year-old at the University of Pennsylvania, Gwynne said, “Elon was usually very reserved, but occasionally he would just get very silly and want me to laugh along with him. So I decided to document him actually smiling.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said their romance was sweet but there was not much affection or ‘PDA’ as Musk largely resisted it. It was during this time that Musk’s mother and supermodel Maye Musk and his siblings had got to know about his plans to make electric vehicles. She also said, “Timeline note here– Elon talked about electric cars being the way of the future back in 1994.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said [EV] was going to be [at the] forefront of the movement and I never doubted that he would be there – he was so matter-of-fact and so sure that electric cars were coming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, honestly, for the last 25 years, I knew Tesla was going to work, that it was going to be successful. There is something so very infectious about Elon’s confidence and clarity.”After graduating from Penn with BA in physics and Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Wharton school, Musk went to Stanford University for PhD in materials science.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musk left Stanford after two days to launch his first start-up amid the internet boom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boar has also cleare issuing of 1.75 crore addiional equity stock optons exercisble into equivalen number of equity shares fully paid up of Rs 10 each, in addition to residual/remaining options which remain ungranted under ESOP 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank's board also cleared the appointment of two independent directors -- Gopal's Jain, Managing Partner and Founder Gaja Capital, and Sivakumar Gopalan, Faculty of the Department of Computer Science and Engineerin, IIT Bombay.The private sector lender posted Rs 201 crore profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 against a net loss of Rs 459 cror in the year-ago period.</p>\r\n",

The structures themselves inspire no great awe, betray no special aura beyond what any bungalow in an upmarket neighbourhood may be accused of exuding. But like with any shrine, it’s about who resides within. Generations of filmgoers have been so enamoured of the man—so filled by a strange energy at his mere appearance on that screen on which their desires are projected — that he seems to approach a numinous stature. Here, on the road outside, vehicles slow down so passengers can quickly take photos, even if it is just a shot of the wooden gate. Pedestrians refresh themselves with water from a giant earthen vessel and prayers begin for a miracle sighting. Vigilant safari-clad men blow their shrill whistles to ensure there’s no crowding. It’s pointless. There’s always one, especially in the evenings. From 1976 to 2000s, this scene used to unfold at Prateeksha, now it is Jalsa. There’s also Janak nearby, a kind of workspace, which has escaped attention. Not surprising perhaps, because it’s at the primary abode that the devout feel the magic of nearness. The hero they have come to worship...He Lives Here. And his name is Amitabh Bachchan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"itgimage\"><img alt=\"\" data-syndication=\"no\" height=\"487\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/202210/Amitabh-lead-b-x487.jpg?waGY2wQwOvrk90BkxBlm5IUxF.7Rap69\" width=\"770\" />\r\n<div class=\"body_caption\">Sharing a tender moment with his father, the renowned Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Mumbai, 1997; (Photo: Bandeep Singh) | <em>In a shoot for an interview in India Today in 2004, when our photographer Bandeep Singh asked Bachchan about the influence his father had on his life, he said, “For me, my father was a colossus. If I can read all that he has written in my lifetime, I’d have attained salvation\"</em></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a Sunday evening, a day when Bachchan, if he’s in town and in the mood, is known to greet and wave at his fans. A quick sampling of the crowd reveals something about the man—the way his force-field has overflowed the usual embankments of space and time. There are fans of all age groups. And the catchment area is also pan-national, not usual for a Hindi film personality. Jessy and Smita, a lawyer and a teacher, respectively, are from Kerala. They have ditched their friends in Juhu beach in the hope of sighting the man they adored in Piku. “There’s something very interesting about him,” says Jessy, as she makes her way to Prateeksha from Jalsa. Standing across the road from them is Vikas Singh, a doctor from Patna, who refers to Bachchan as a “superhero”. Singh’s words are tinged with awe as he shares his long list of favourite Bachchan films. “He is a league apart,” he says. “So many have gone, but he is still performing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"quotes\">\r\n<blockquote><em>Deewaar, Sholay, Trishul, Don, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar</em> and <em>Kaala Patthar</em> changed not just Amitabh’s fate but the very heart and culture of Hindi cinema</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘still’ is pertinent because Bachchan turns 80 on October 11. He made his feature film debut at the age of 27. A different epoch: the Beatles were still playing, a fledgling Doordarshan had not even reached Bombay, and women in Hindi films were still cycling to picnics with their hair in beehive buns, singing pretty songs. Fifty-three years later, all that is water down the bridge, but he is ‘still’ on top of his game. So much so that he puts far younger peers to shame with his sheer, jaw-dropping volume of work, as with his still-undimmed work ethic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even a phenomenon has to start somewhere. A quiet, dignified entry in a film called <em>Saat Hindustani </em>(1969) performed that historic function, but done by the old writer-director Khwaja Ahmad Abbas—the man behind <em>Dharti Ke Lal</em> (1946) and many of Raj Kapoor’s films—his idealistic vein also kept it off-Broadway, so to speak. The mainstream largely shunned the tall, gangly youth for a few more years, with only a trickle of minor films coming his way. Navin Nishchol, who debuted a year after Bachchan, rose to stardom faster—and got paid more. It was still a world made for romantic heroes with <em>khubani ka meetha</em> faces. So nobody could have anticipated what happened thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 58px;\">A</span></strong></span></span> supporting role in Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s <em>Anand</em> (1971) was a bend in the road—even next to the bravura, author-backed role of superstar Rajesh Khanna, Bachchan’s quiet intensity filtered through. Filmmakers slowly learnt to harness that flame. Finally, <em>Zanjeer</em> (1973) scaled that up to full-scale arson. Bachchan’s honest cop, tormented by inner and outer demons, burst forth on the Seventies with such a primal force that it caught the zeitgeist. It was a time of inner ferment for the nation and its youth, beginning to chafe in such rage at the corrupt, stagnant system that the Emergency was soon imposed in a vain bid to bottle it up. Bachchan’s ‘Angry Young Man’ became the very embodiment of that larger storm. And stayed there, like a one-man forest fire, through the decade and beyond. With films like <em>Deewaar, Sholay, Trishul, Don, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar</em> and <em>Kaala Patthar</em>, what changed was not merely Amitabh Bachchan’s fate, but the very heart and culture of Hindi cinema. Its very tone and tenor. Through those times, he towered over everything precisely because he had co-authored those times, like some deity in an act of Creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who came in late, there were more unbelievable twists in the plot—careening between the demigodly status and destitution. A bout of injury and ill health, a diversion to politics that ended as ignominiously as it started gloriously, a filmography that sputtered down to largely inconsequential films that sought to ride on his past popularity without ever recreating anything like his past incandescence, and then a fateful turn to business. A company was set up that dared to think big but managed to end small...very small. As the century wound down, the Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Limited was winding up in bankruptcy—and taking down a human piece of history with it. Then as the clock struck the new millennium, the pendulum swung again to the other side. A remarkable second innings started. <em>Kaun Banega Crorepati</em> (KBC), a quiz show on Star TV, got Bachchan right into drawing rooms...and people reacted as if divinity was paying a visitation in humanised form. And slowly, the films started striking a second burst of efflorescence too—like a Nilgiri kurinji plant flowering after a gap of 14 years. Why is Amitabh Bachchan a piece of living history? Because that phase, again unbelievably, is still with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>The Marathon Man</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For, there was no escaping Bachchan in 2022—as he was going on 80. In April release <em>Runway 34</em>, he was playing a no-nonsense head of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, grilling and lecturing a pompous pilot (Ajay Devgn, a next-generation hero who’s himself no spring chicken now). In September, Bachchan was a wise, sword-wielding mentor in <em>Brahmastra</em>. The film, having earned Rs 247 crore nationwide, is still running in cinema halls. But he has another one slated for the marquee—<em>Goodbye</em>. His co-star is Rashmika Mandanna of <em>Pushpa</em> fame, who is just a year senior to Bachchan’s granddaughter, Navya Naveli Nanda. Audiences will see him on the big screen in November too, in Sooraj Barjatya’s <em>Uunchai</em>, alongside Anupam Kher and Boman Irani. And he’s still on the small screen, clocking in 14 hours a day to shoot <em>KBC</em>, which is in its 14th season. With this kind of a chock-a-block calendar, one would think this is the 1970s-80s, with Bachchan working at such a pace he hardly had time for family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 58px;\">I</span></strong></span></span>t was in 1980, when he was at the summit and at his prolific best, that India Today featured him on the cover and christened him ‘The One-Man Industry’. Perhaps too happening to be considered an ‘institution’ yet, like older thespians like Dilip Kumar would have been then. But with a good ensemble of films that showcased an eclectic actorly repertoire, comparisons may have started getting made. Two years later, the two came face to face in <em>Shakti</em>. But four decades later, Bachchan’s career has outlasted other thespian luminaries not just by the sheer volume of films he has done—over 180 and counting, excluding the innumerable ones as narrator—but also with the range of his work. Now, though he’s <em>still </em>happening, no one would hesitate to confer on him nobler encomiums—like ‘the legend’, or ‘an institution’. His iconic status, as well as his ease before the camera, is precisely what makes him one of the most-trusted names among brands who seek his face and, more significantly, that deep baritone to sell their products and services. The Duff &amp; Phelps Celebrity Brand Valuation Study of 2021 ranked Bachchan sixth, with a brand value of $54.2 million. Even governments have counted on him for their public service advertising campaigns like ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ or to urge citizens to be cautious during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"quotes\">\r\n<blockquote>Four decades on, Bachchan’s career has outlasted other thespian luminaries not just by the volume of his films but also the range of work</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Age usually slows a person, but in Bachchan’s case, his zeal to perform and engage with his fans—whether via his films or many social media accounts, including the blog <em>Bol Bachchan</em>—is untouched by senescence. As soon as the second lockdown ended, eager to face the camera again, he called his go-to photographer Avinash Gowariker over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our country has seen many superstars, but stardom with his kind of longevity is a rarity and I think it will be very difficult to match up to it,” says <em>Dangal </em>maker Nitesh Tiwari, who directed Bachchan in <em>Bhootnath Returns</em> and also worked with him in the<em> KBC</em> ad campaigns. Like many directors of today, Tiwari grew up on a healthy diet of Bachchan films. He wept for his hero at the end of <em>Muqaddar ka Sikandar</em>; he smiled when he couldn’t get tickets to <em>Hum</em> in Gwalior...because it meant Bachchan had finally had a hit after a bad run; and he was “nervous as hell” when, as executive creative director of Leo Burnett, he sat in Bachchan’s office in Janak to narrate the “<em>Koi sawal chhota nahin hota</em>” promotional campaign for <em>KBC</em>. His mother and her family, he notes, were more proud when they learned he was working with Bachchan than when he got into IIT Bombay. “A childlike curiosity keeps him going,” adds Tiwari. “He approaches a 30-second commercial or a two-and-a-half-hour film with the same rigour.”</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"caption caption-img\"><span><img alt=\"Amitabh with Toby Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Great Gatsby, his Hollywood debut; (Photo: India Picture Collection)\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/inline-images/Amitabh-lead-d.jpg?VersionId=GbZmIF48x7JdksfFkinaBwwmfJeYbsU1\" /><span title=\"Click and drag to resize\">​</span></span>\r\n\r\n<figcaption data-placeholder=\"Enter caption here\">Amitabh with Toby Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Great Gatsby, his Hollywood debut; (Photo: India Picture Collection)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost everyone who has worked with him credits Bachchan’s long shelf-life to his discipline or “<em>anushaasan</em>”, as his character in <em>Mohabbatein</em> would say. Leena Yadav, who directed him in <em>Teen Patti</em>, recalls how she’d tell the four newcomers in the film—which included Shraddha Kapoor—to seek inspiration from his sense of punctuality and preparedness. In the unlikely event of him running late, he is known to message and inform the director directly and expects an acknowledgement, as Tiwari would learn one day. Then there’s the humility. Nothing holds him back from setting aside years of experience and countless accolades to learn from new creators, regardless of their age. Filmmakers mention how he is totally open to retakes and suggestions. And yet, there’s a dignified kind of gravitas. “<em>Ek thahraav bhi hai</em>,” as Leena Yadav puts it. “He doesn’t underline his own presence, but then you can’t help not underline it. However humbly he is sitting there, he is Amitabh Bachchan.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>The Mythical Being</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This aura, what R. Balki calls the “myth and mystique”, also transmits itself to viewers. And that’s why audiences cannot get enough of him. Balki, one of his most frequent collaborators in the past 15 years and who has written yet another cameo for him in the 2023 release Ghoomer, puts his finger too on that X-factor. It’s born of “his effort and the effort of the world which has preserved the myth”, he says. “What has happened due to it is that we are not able to fathom this entity, which will never come again. Cinema is never going to have stars like Bachchan because they (the present lot) are too accessible and don’t have that kind of bigness.” The enigma endures, especially since Bachchan has cut down his media interactions in the past decade. Even those who worked with him in the early stages of his career, like renowned screenwriter-lyricist Javed Akhtar, who co-wrote some of Bachchan’s most iconic roles in <em>Zanjeer</em> and <em>Deewar</em>, say, “Anybody who claims to know Amitabh Bachchan is lying. He is a very reserved and private person.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That trait was indeed partly why a perception was fostered of a man who came out of no- where to kick down the doors of Hindi cinema. But of course, Amitabh did not come out of nowhere. Born to renowned Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan (né Srivastava; 1907-2003) and his Sikh wife Teji, a psychology professor and social activist, there was quite a bit of old-style legacy there—including a storied bond with the Nehru-Gandhi family. Nehru had sponsored Harivansh Rai’s senior doctoral thesis at Cambridge, and on his return, he had joined as head of the External Affairs Ministry’s Hindi division. Amitabh and his brother Ajitabh had thus been friends with the Gandhi siblings—Rajiv and Sanjay—since childhood. In fact, in January 1968, a year before Amitabh debuted in cinema, as Sonia Maino arrived from Italy to marry Rajiv Gandhi, it was Amitabh who received her. And she stayed at the Bachchan residence in Delhi for a few weeks. But while that family friendship was to sour, his own poet-father would remain an endless inspirational resource for Amitabh.In a shoot for an interview to India Today in 2004, when our photographer Bandeep Singh asked him about that influence, he said, “For me, my father was a colossus. If I can read all that he has written in my lifetime, I’d have attained salvation.” That inner quietude—which forms something like a screen between him and the world and often stumps even film industry colleagues—is not surprising then.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"caption caption-img\"><span><img alt=\"A spirited Amitabh on the first day of shooting after the end of the Covid lockdown in 2021; (Photo: Avinash Gowariker)\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/inline-images/Amitabh-lead-e.jpg?VersionId=ONkynDAwFuDYMzIc0Yr4VBhMBdGyIjB0\" /><span title=\"Click and drag to resize\">​</span></span>\r\n\r\n<figcaption data-placeholder=\"Enter caption here\">A spirited Amitabh on the first day of shooting after the end of the Covid lockdown in 2021; (Photo: Avinash Gowariker)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>If there’s one platform where audiences come closest to knowing Bachchan, it is <em>KBC</em>. On it, you see him switch from being the teasing paternal figure prodding a contestant on marriage to the empathetic man when a woman bemoans not being allowed to study further. He also discloses memorable instances from his personal life and anecdotes from his storied career. The show, famously, arrived at a time when Bachchan was struggling for financial security and professional relevance in a film industry that was evolving—the multiplex boom had encouraged the rise of independent cinema that deviated from formula, his old mainstay. His son, Abhishek, had made his debut with <em>Refugee</em> (2000); Shah Rukh Khan was the man of the moment, with the other Khans—Aamir and Salman—giving him a run for his money. At 59, Bachchan was very cognisant of the fact that attempting to stay the commercial Bollywood hero—as with the ill-fated <em>Mrityudaata</em>—was pointless; those days were over and he needed substantial parts that wouldn’t diminish his legend. But in showbiz, out of sight equals out of mind. So playing “the friend, philosopher and guide” on <em>KBC</em> was a gamechanger, as Sameer Nair, then executive vice-president, programming, at Star Plus and a forever Bachchan fan, puts it. “When the show came on at 8 pm, the remote was controlled by parents who were Bachchan fans while the kids were fans of the Khans,” notes Nair. But soon, sporting a grey French beard, seamlessly shuttling between fluent Hindi and English and exuding charm and positivity, Bachchan expanded his fan base among the young.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"quotes\">\r\n<blockquote>If there’s one platform where audiences come closest to getting to know Bachchan, it’s <em>KBC</em>. Here, he shares vignettes of his life and career</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also a period when he would increase his advertising portfolio and come into contact with a new breed of creators like Shoojit Sircar and Balki, who’d later give him a gift every actor craves for: the opportunity to reinvent himself. Sircar’s first film with Bachchan, <em>Shoebite</em>, hasn’t yet seen the light of day, but it led to one of the most fruitful collaborations in his second inning. “We have that kind of faith in each other that we can talk about anything,” Sircar once told india today in an interview. “I have no agenda with him and he recognises that. As a personality, he is intimidating but, inside, he is an innocent child who just wants to act.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachchan’s talent, in this latter phase, was also very much about how he moulded it. Luck played a role, too, as a new breed of filmmakers emerged, with offbeat narratives scripted with Bachchan in mind—Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s <em>Aks</em>, Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s <em>Black</em>, Balki’s <em>Paa</em>, to name a few. The actor, in turn, pounced on those scripts with the same intensity he would have had for essaying Gogol’s Mayor back in Sherwood College. And, in the process, he got reintroduced to a new audience. For the millennials, he wasn’t “the angry young man” they had seen on satellite TV in the 1990s but the strict principal of <em>Mohabbatein</em>, the flirt of <em>Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</em>, the imposing politician of <em>Sarkar,</em> the arrogant chef of <em>Cheeni Kum</em>, the tenacious lawyer of <em>Pink</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>The First Wave</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Aysha Iqbal Viswamohan, professor, film studies, IIT Madras, is one of the many cinephiles who observed the Bachchan ‘first wave’ up close. That decade-long golden streak beginning with<em> Zanjeer</em> that would lead his contemporary Jeetendra to remark that he was Hindi cinema’s “No. 1 to 10 star”. Viswamohan attributes the actor’s mass appeal to his ability to “lend a touch of authenticity” to the innumerable working-class heroes he played. Throughout, Bachchan was changing the definition of what constituted a mainstream Hindi film hero. Says Viswamohan: “He was a perfect antidote to the heightened romanticism of Rajesh Khanna. His unique embodiment of hegemonic masculinity fitted Salim-Javed’s conception of a lone-ranger, urban cowboy, vigilante hero as popularised by Hollywood stars like Clint Eastwood and Steve McQueen. To this, he added a style of brooding intensity that harked back to Dilip Kumar. The result of this concoction was a new kind of morally ambiguous hero that suited the temper of the changing times.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"quotes\">\r\n<blockquote>Almost everyone who has worked with him credits Bachchan’s long shelf-life to his discipline. And his humility. He’s forever open to retakes and suggestions</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>But like in his new phase, Bachchan was bold with his choices at his peak, not allowing himself to be boxed in. The angry young man also dabbled memorably with romance (<em>Kabhi Kabhie, Silsila</em>), comedy (<em>Chupke Chupke, Amar Akbar Anthony, Mr Natwarlal, Namak Halal</em>), and served up a more sensitive side in films like<em> Alaap</em> (1977) and<em> Manzil </em>(1979), even if they weren’t received as well as his action-heavy dramas. It’s this variegated filmography that led to diehard fans like S.M.M. Ausaja, author, film historian and archivist, who started collecting Bachchan memorabilia in 1981 when still in school. Ausaja will admit that his star wasn’t infallible. “It’s frivolous to say he hasn’t done bad films or there was no fall. But even in those, there are moments where he stood out,” says Ausaja. Today, Ausaja sits on 5,000 items—posters, film stills, lobby cards, magazines, slides, transparencies, books, postcards. The labour of his love will make its way into <em>The Bachchans</em>, a four-kg, 600-page coffeetabler chronicling three generations of the family, beginning with Bachchan’s grandfather, Pratap Narain Srivastava in Pratapgarh, and ending with his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. With Bachchan having already launched his two other books, Ausaja is hopeful his idol will do the honours this time too in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#800000;\"><strong>Making/ Preserving History</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As his cult grew, Bachchan became distinctly aware of his own distinct place in Indian cinema. Filmmaker, archivist and restorer Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, who founded the Film Heritage Foundation of which Bachchan is a brand ambassador, notes that the actor preserved 35mm celluloid of his films like <em>Mili, Chupke Chupke, Zanjeer</em> and <em>Don</em> in an air-conditioned room at his Juhu house. Audiences in 18 cities can watch 11 of his 1970s and ’80s classics from October 8-11 at PVR cinemas in an FHF retrospective called <em>Bachchan: Back to the Beginning</em>. If there’s one living actor who merits a retrospective, it is of course Bachchan. With tickets priced at Rs 80, Dungarpur says most shows are sold out—and even actors are calling seeking tickets for <em>Amar Akbar Anthony</em>. “There’s nobody who bridges the past, present and future of Indian cinema better than Mr Bachchan,” says Dungarpur, whose foundation is entrusted with the Bachchan archive. “He has preserved the past and continues to preserve the present, as evident by his numbered tweets. Most people exist and allow things to happen [to them], but he is aware of the world he lives in.” He writes his own tweets and blog entries. Beyond technology, Bachchan has kept up with the times sartorially too, carrying off hoodies and sweatpants or blingy brooches with elan. He recently even introduced a new line of perfumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But since 1999, his focus has been acting. Having learned from the ABCL debacle, AB Corp has stuck to co-producing a few films. Next year, audiences will see three generati­ons of Bachchans. His grandson, Agastya Nanda, makes his debut in Zoya Akhtar’s Netflix film <em>The Archies</em>; son Abhishek will feature in Balki’s <em>Ghoomer</em> and Amitabh, at the grand age of 80, has the multilingual <em>Project K</em> alongside Deepika Padukone and Prabhas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, after his maiden home production <em>Mrityudaata</em> flopped, india today wrote, “The question is: where does Bachchan go from here?” Little did we, or anyone, know that 25 years later, we’d “still” be talking about him. His name means ‘the light that won’t fade’. Fittingly, thus, it illuminates darkened cinema halls, living room televisions and now our mobile screens. That’s how long his reign has been. The answer to that question, though? Here it goes: Amitabh Bachchan is here to perform until his last breath. And the world is a better place for it.</p>\r\n",

Sharing a picture of Musk as a 23-year-old at the University of Pennsylvania, Gwynne said, “Elon was usually very reserved, but occasionally he would just get very silly and want me to laugh along with him. So I decided to document him actually smiling.”&nbsp;\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said their romance was 10% sweet but there was not much affection or ‘PDA’ as Musk largely resisted it. It was during this time that Musk’s mother and supermodel Maye Musk and his siblings had got to know about his plans to make electric@vehicles. She also said, “Timeline note here– Elon talked about electric cars being the way of the future back in 1994. He said [EV] was going to be [at the] forefront of the movement and I never doubted that he would be there – he was so matter-of-fact and so sure that electric cars were coming. So, honestly, for the last 25 years, I knew Tesla was going to work, that it was going to be successful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is something so very infectious about Elon’s confidence and clarity.”After graduating from Penn with BA in physics and Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Wharton school, Musk went to Stanford* University for PhD in #materials science.

In turn, this has led to the rise of efficient, cost-effective renewable energy sources. Among these renewable energy sources, pumped-storage hydroelectricity stands out for its unique flexibility. In this article, we’ll explore what this energy source is, its applications, and details of a game-changing pilot project implemented in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a process of generating energy using the water cycle. Water stored in higher elevation reservoirs is pumped and released to the lower elevation one through turbines valves. During the process, the water’s kinetic energy is converted into electricity. This electricity can then be used by customers or consumed by the power grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the demand for electricity is low, the turbines are switched on along with the pumps to fill the higher elevation reservoir. This ensures that there is enough power available to meet the electricity needs when the demand increases. So, pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a system that can be used in an energy-efficient manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solar Power in India</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are gaining traction in India. Madhya Pradesh, a state located in Central India, has pioneered the development of renewable energy sources. In 2018, the state of Madhya Pradesh installed the world’s largest solar power project, the Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Plant. This project can generate 750 megawatts of electricity, nearly 10 percent of India’s total solar power output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bhoj Metro, a pump-to-storage hydropower project, is another pioneering example of renewable energy development in Madhya Pradesh. This ambitious project is the first of its kind in India. The project seeks to use a combination of solar and hydropower to generate electricity throughout the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity and Solar Power</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bhoj Metro is breaking new grounds in its innovative combination of pumped-storage hydroelectricity and solar power. The project includes constructing a reservoir with a capacity of 4.5 million cubic meters and installing a 600 megawatt solar power park. What makes this project unique is the use of solar energy to power the pumps to fill the reservoir during peak hours. Then, the stored water of the reservoir is released through turbines to generate electricity during low-demand hours. This helps optimize electricity production and distribution. In short, the solar panels fill the reservoir while the hydropower is used to generate electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is an innovative, cost-efficient renewable energy source that offers unprecedented flexibility. Its application in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhoj Metro project is a game changer in terms of optimally combining hydropower and solar power to produce electricity. This project’s success serves as an inspiration for similar ventures in other parts of the world. Going forward, we can expect to see more cost-effective, energy-efficient solutions for electricity generation thanks to this groundbreaking project in Madhya Pradesh.</p>\r\n",

The headline read: \"Texas child shown in back-to-school advertisement wearing body armour.\" The report mentioned that a group of mothers in Texas commissioned this advert.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Ad campaign news\" class=\"cb-img-res\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dbcdd38b-140c-440b-bb71-47e502a31e5b\" id=\"\" src=\"https://static-dev.indiatodayonline.in/indiatoday/inline-images/Image%203%20%281%29.jpg\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reportedly, this advertisement was curated to make a stand against Texas Governor Greg Abbott after the incident at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that happened just before the summer break. Per a report from <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/politics/article/Back-to-school-ad-shows-Texas-child-wearing-body-17374969.php\" target=\"_blank\">Chron</a>, published on August 17, 2022, a group called \"Mothers Against Greg Abbott\" was formed before the summer vacation was over and children started to return to their classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A search with subsequent keywords took us to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbRz0rfx-XM\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a> named \"Mothers Against Greg Abbott,\" where we found the original 30-second-long video featuring the frame in question around the 18-second timestamp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Ad campaign\" class=\"cb-img-res\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8dd4e154-397e-40eb-bd83-38d6d97ea59b\" id=\"\" src=\"https://static-dev.indiatodayonline.in/indiatoday/inline-images/Image%204%20%281%29.jpg\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The description of the video reads, \"Kids all over Texas and the United States are getting ready for back to school, but something feels different this year. Our kids are not soldiers, regardless of what the extreme right thinks. Whether you're a Republican, a Democrat, or neither, it's time to come together and demand meaningful gun safety reform now. Please go here to donate to help us get these ads on the air.\" This made it clear that it was an ad campaign.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, we also found news <a href=\"http://bitly.ws/PLDR\" target=\"_blank\">articles</a> that reported how a mother created a “bulletproof” <a href=\"http://bitly.ws/PLDV\" target=\"_blank\">back-to-school dress</a>. While the dress wasn't bulletproof, it was designed to make a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the claim of a mother sending her child with a bulletproof outfit in Texas is not true.</p>\r\n",

This comes after boycott calls marred the performance of one of the most anticipated movies, Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha as well as Akshay Kumar’s Raksha Bandhan. The latest boycott call for Brahmastra does not bode well for an industry that has delivered a string of big-budget flops. The boycott call also raises questions on Ranbir Kapoor’s capability of delivering a hit, following the dismal box office performance of Shamshera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The calls to boycott Ayan Mukerji-directorial Brahmastra were revived after Bhatt, in an interview with Mid-Day said, “I can’t keep defending myself verbally. And if you don’t like me, don’t watch me. I can’t help it.” She was responding to a question on how trolling – she has been the subject of some vicious trolling –&nbsp; impacts her.She had further stated that it is not something she can do anything about since people have something or the other to say, but she hopes to prove to them with her movies that she is actually worth the space she occupies. She said that she does feel bad but she hopes to shut such conversations with her movies.esla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s college sweetheart Jennifer Gwynne has auctioned off her photos with Musk off late.&nbsp; These photos show Musk as a 20-year-old college student having fun around the University of Pennsylvania campus. Gwynne, who currently lives with her stepson in South Carolina, is selling these photos via RR Auction to raise money for her stepson’s tuition fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embedcode\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CgRbJ3mgCje/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

So I decided to document him actually smiling.”She said their romance was sweet but there was not much affection or ‘PDA’ as Musk largely resisted it. It was during this time that Musk’s mother and supermodel Maye Musk and his siblings had got to know about his plans to make electric vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also said, “Timeline note here– Elon talked about electric cars being the way of the future back in 1994. He said [EV] was going to be [at the] forefront of the movement and I never doubted that he would be there – he was so matter-of-fact and so sure that electric cars were coming. So, honestly, for the last 25 years, I knew Tesla was going to work, that it was going to be successful. There is something so very infectious about Elon’s confidence and clarity.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduating from Penn with BA in physics and Bachelor of Science degree in economics from Wharton school, Musk went to Stanford University for PhD in materials science. Musk left Stanford after two days to launch his first start-up amid the internet boom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The pink number featured a corset-style bodice and dramatic frilled sleeves. The hem of the dress also displayed frills and complemented the diva’s toned figure perfectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malavika minimally accessorised with a dainty necklace to let her outfit do all the talking. As far as her makeup was concerned, she went with a dewy base, neutral eyeshadow, generous coats of mascara, lots of blush and deep pink lipstick. She tied her hair in a low ponytail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When you constantly wear your heart on your sleeve you just need a little extra fabric sometimes,” reads the caption of the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See pics here:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcFL4ZlMFAU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

And, her latest Instagram post is proof of that. For an appearance on Dance Deewane Juniors, the diva looked like an absolute doll in a pink polka-dot dress by Gauri and Nainika. The pictures are just too gorgeous and we are swooning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/fashion/story/nora-fatehi-in-overcoat-and-leather-pants-raises-the-style-quotient-with-rs-2-2-lakh-bag-see-pics-1913298-2022-02-15\" target=\"_blank\">What Nora wore was a pink polka-dot dress.</a> The cute number featured a one-shoulder design and frills on the hem and bodice. It was cinched at the waist with a fabric belt and complemented the diva’s toned figure perfectly. She styled it with a pair of embellished pink stilettos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To accessorise, Nora opted for chunky pearl studs and matching rings. She also carried her mini white Lady Dior bag. As far as her makeup was concerned, she went with a dewy base, a dab of eyeshadow and mascara, blush and bright pink lipstick. She styled her hair in a side-swept fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I believe that life is a prize. But to live, doesn't mean you're alive,” reads the caption of the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See pics here:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcID2dABI7u/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The pink number featured a corset-style bodice and dramatic frilled sleeves. The hem of the dress also displayed frills and complemented the diva’s toned figure perfectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malavika minimally accessorised with a dainty necklace to let her outfit do all the talking. As far as her makeup was concerned, she went with a dewy base, neutral eyeshadow, generous coats of mascara, lots of blush and deep pink lipstick. She tied her hair in a low ponytail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When you constantly wear your heart on your sleeve you just need a little extra fabric sometimes,” reads the caption of the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See pics here:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcFL4ZlMFAU/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Mix in the olive oil until the dressing has emulsified. Set aside. Next, rub the chicken breasts with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat up oil in a pan and cook the chicken on the first side for 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken and cover the pan with a lid to allow it to cook through for 7-10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 5-10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arrange the lettuce in a large bowl and add the cooked chicken, quartered hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber and avocado. Pour the dressing. Mix and enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>FASHIONABLY YOURS</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPszoH-MSSh/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;
