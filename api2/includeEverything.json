            "no_desc_withouthtml": "<p>A political row has erupted following Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s surprise resignation, with the Opposition linking the move to the absence of key ministers -- JP Nadda and Kiren Rijiju -- at a crucial Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting. The Congress claimed that Dhankhar was upset over the absence of Nadda, the Leader of the House, and Rijiju, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, at Monday’s BAC meeting. Nadda, however, said they were engaged in important parliamentary work and had duly informed the Chairman in advance.</p><p>The Business Advisory Committee of the Rajya Sabha plays a key role in recommending the allocation of time for government legislative and other business.</p><p>The first meeting was held at 12.30 pm and was reportedly attended by most members, including Nadda and Rijiju. After some discussion, the BAC decided to reconvene at 4.30 pm. However, when the meeting resumed, both ministers were absent. In their absence, Union Minister L Murugan represented the government at the second meeting.</p><p>Murugan requested Dhankhar to reschedule the meeting for the following day. According to sources, the committee met twice on Monday, but both meetings remained inconclusive.</p><h3>DUE TO IMPORTANT WORK: JP NADDA EXPLAINS NO SHOW</h3><p>Meanwhile, Nadda explained their absence by saying that both ministers were occupied with important parliamentary work and had informed the Vice President.</p><p>\"Kiren Rijiju and I did not attend the meeting called by the Vice President at 4:30 PM because we were occupied with other important parliamentary work, and prior intimation was given to the office of the Honourable Vice President,\" he said.</p><p>The Congress has also highlighted a remark made by Nadda in the Rajya Sabha, where he said, “Nothing will go on record, only what I say will go on record,” in response to the Opposition's uproar, calling it an “insult” to the Vice President.</p><p>On this, Nadda said, \"As for what I said in the Rajya Sabha, that whatever I say will go on record, it was directed at the interrupting Opposition MPs, not at the Chair\".</p><h3>SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS HAPPENED: CONGRESS</h3><p>Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who was part of the BAC, alleged that Vice President Dhankhar was not personally informed about the ministers' absence and the committee members waited for the ministers to arrive.</p><p>\"It waited for Shri Nadda and Shri Rijiju to arrive. They never came. Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar was not personally informed that the two senior Ministers were not attending. Rightly he took umbrage and rescheduled the BAC for today at 1 pm,\" Ramesh said.</p><p>So \"something very serious\" happened yesterday between 1 pm and 4.30 pm to account for the deliberate absence of Nadda and Rijiju from the second BAC yesterday, he said in a post on Tuesday.</p><p>In a sudden and unexpected move late Monday evening, on the first day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned from his post citing medical reasons, leaving leaders across the political spectrum in disbelief.</p><p>On what turned out to be his final day in office, Dhankhar presided over proceedings in the Rajya Sabha and was involved in discussions on the impeachment motion against Justice Yashwant Varma. Apart from the Business Advisory Committee, he also met with opposition leaders, yet gave no indication of any health issues or plans to step down.</p><p>Dhankhar, 74, assumed office in August 2022 and was set to serve until 2027. During his eventful tenure as Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, he had multiple confrontations with the Opposition, which even moved a motion seeking his removal, a first in independent India for a sitting Vice President. The motion, however, was later rejected by Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh.</p><p>Dhankhar is the third Vice President of India, after VV Giri and R Venkataraman, to resign before completing his term. Both Giri and Venkataraman had stepped down to contest the presidential election.</p>",

Pranoy Mahanta, a Class Ten student from Nasbor village in Biswanath, is no ordinary teenager. His deep commitment to wildlife conservation, painstaking documentation of biodiversity, and tireless efforts to raise awareness among peers and elders alike have made him a beacon of hope for the preservation of Assam’s rich natural heritage.</p><p>Though still in school, Pranoy has already built an impressive record of fieldwork, writing, photography, and community activism. His passion is not merely academic: it is rooted in personal experience, family influence, and a determination to see real change on the ground. This is his story—a story of early inspiration, hard-won achievements, persistent challenges, and an unwavering vision for a greener, more harmonious future.</p><p><strong>The Spark: Childhood encounters with nature</strong>:</p><p>Pranoy’s journey into the world of wildlife began at the tender age of five, guided by the steady hand of his father, Gakul Mahanta. A teacher by profession, his father is also an environmental activist who serves as the Environmental and Education Secretary at Nature’s Bonyapran, a local conservation group in Biswanath.</p><p>Through his father’s activism, Pranoy was introduced to the lush, fragile wilderness of the Behali Wildlife Sanctuary—then still classified as a Reserve Forest. Behali was a battleground of sorts: threatened by encroachment, illegal logging, and poaching. Pranoy witnessed first-hand the tireless work of his father and other Nature’s Bonyapran members to save this unique patch of forest. Their efforts aimed not only to halt destruction but to convince authorities to officially declare Behali a wildlife sanctuary—a goal that was eventually realized.</p>",

            "no_desc_withouthtml": "<p>When Indian cinema is dominated by action dramas with a newfound love for extreme violence and gore, there’s always something soothing about heartwarming dramas. Be it a simple love story or a family drama or a comedy drama, they remind you of the good old times. Director Shanmuga Priyan’s ‘Love Marriage’, a remake of the Telugu film, ‘Ashoka Vanmulo Arjuna Kalyanam', has all the elements to be that cutesy film that will leave a smile on your face. Did it succeed in its mission? Let’s find out!</p><p>Ramachandran (Vikram Prabhu) is a 33-year-old bachelor who is waiting to get married. A thorough gentleman, the only progressive man in a family of regressive people, goes through arranged marriage. He, along with his family and extended family, travels to a different town to meet a potential bride, which is followed by his engagement. One meeting is all it takes for Ram to get engaged to Ambika (Sushmitha Bhat) old-school style.</p><p>As he tries to strike up a conversation with Ambika, she resists, which instils doubts about his decision. However, the Covid-19 lockdown forces Ram’s family to stay at Ambika’s home. This situation leads Ramchandran to deal with the struggles of managing his budding relationship with Ambika, along with tackling regressive family members, who criticise every move of the bride and her family.</p><p>Director Shanmuga Priyan’s ‘Love Marriage’ has all the ingredients to make a fun-filled family drama that gives a glimpse into the struggles of an arranged marriage. Ram’s parents see him as a burden as he has crossed the limit of what is considered as a marriageable age. They agree to find a bride belonging to a different caste. There’s a relative who keeps cribbing about everything and another who indulges in alcohol on every occasion.</p><p>From the bride’s side, there’s a non-stop jabbermouth uncle and a cute bride’s sister to make things interesting. Yet, with all these quirky characters, the film doesn’t achieve its full potential. The first half of the film treads smoothly because it doesn’t take itself seriously. Though predictable, the story moves forward with the gradual introduction of conflicts, which makes one wonder what’s next. But, when the film starts taking itself seriously, it falls prey to redundancy and outdated ideas.</p><p>With a taut runtime of two hours, ‘Love Marriage’ still feels stretched because of its overdramatic and convenient turn of events in the second half. The whole stretch featuring Vikram Prabhu’s Ramachandran and Meenakshi Dinesh’s ‘Radha’ feels inorganic and forced. However, the film gets the message right - especially when Ram talks about how society pressures people to live and lead a life based on a timeline that everyone follows.</p><p>Vikram Prabhu is perfect as Ramachandran and the way he portrays the stages of getting to know a girl to becoming her partner is enjoyable. Ambika, as the coy bride, expresses with her eyes. Meenakshi Dinesh looks effervescent in a role that’s quite cliched. The film could have done away with the songs and an unfunny cameo by a veteran actor, which added nothing to the story. Ramesh Thilak, Gajaraj and Aruldoss played supporting roles to the best of their abilities.</p><p>Cinematographer Madhan Christopher’s frames show the goodness of the village, while Sean Roldan’s music, though soothing, feels jarring at moments.</p><p>‘Love Marriage’ is a film that could have become a complete laughter riot given its potential. Nonetheless, it ends up as a predictable family film that reminds you of the early 2000s.</p>",

The DGCA is entrusted with regulatory oversight and ensures compliance of airlines with aviation standards.</p><p>The report stated that while regulatory compliance remains essential, the rapid expansion of infrastructure - with airports increasing from 74 in 2014 to 147 in 2022 and a target of 220 by 2024-255 - necessitates proportional growth in security capabilities and accident investigation resources.</p><p>\"It is imperative to assess whether these funds are adequate to strengthen security infrastructure and enhance investigative capabilities. As aviation expands to Tier Il and III cities under the modified UDAN scheme, security infrastructure and capabilities must be extended proportionally,\" the report further said.</p><h3>KEY BODIES UNDERSTAFFED</h3><p>The panel also raised serious concerns over the limited manpower in the DGCA, BCAS, and the Airports Authority of India (AAI).</p><p>As per the 375th report on Demands for Grants (2025–26) of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, more than 53% of positions are vacant in the DGCA, 35% in the BCAS, and 17% in the AAI, which manages airport infrastructure.</p>",

It was a game of soft greens and softer manners, where grace held sway. Today, those gentlemen seem to have wandered a few miles south to Wimbledon, where tennis still dances to a gentler tune.</p><p>On a sunlit Sunday, Lord's and the All England Lawn Tennis Club, though neighbours in London, stood worlds apart-a cultural dance choreographed by time. At Wimbledon, the Gentlemen's Singles Final unfolded like a ballet, with <strong><a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/jannik-sinner-carlos-alcaraz-new-tennis-rivalry-wimbledon-future-2755270-2025-07-14\" target=\"_blank\">Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner weaving a duet</a></strong> of skill and respect. At Lord's, the India-England Test match roared like a storm, all grit and fire, as if the old game had turned into a gladiatorial duel.</p><h3>Wimbledon's Gentle Duet</h3><p>At Wimbledon, <strong><a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/tennis/story/jannik-sinner-carlos-alcaraz-wimbledon-final-title-2755245-2025-07-13\" target=\"_blank\">Jannik Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz</a></strong> in four sets (4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4), claiming his first Wimbledon title and fourth Grand Slam. He became the first Italian to win the coveted title.</p>",
