Before boarding his private plane at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport, he repeated his claim that the prosecution - along with the others he faces - is politically motivated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"What has taken place here is a travesty of justice,\" he told reporters. \"I did nothing wrong, and everybody knows it.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, 77, already has entered uncharted territory as the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges, even as he mounts another campaign for the White House next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Far from damaging his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination, however, the four cases filed against him have only bolstered his standing. He holds a commanding polling lead in the Republican race to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2024 election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dozens of supporters, waving Trump banners and American flags, jostled for a glimpse as Trump arrived at the jail. Among the Trump backers gathered outside was Georgia U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the former president's most loyal congressional allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lyle Rayworth, 49, who is in the aviation industry in the Atlanta area, had been waiting near the jailhouse for 10 hours, since early on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Yeah, I'm hoping he sees me waving the flags, showing support,\" Rayworth said as he awaited Trump's arrival. \"He needs us.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image is certain to be circulated widely by Trump's foes and supporters alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>'A MORE POPULAR IMAGE THAN THE MONA LISA'</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We want to put it on a T-shirt. It will go worldwide. It will be a more popular image than the Mona Lisa,\" said Laura Loomer, 30, a Republican former congressional candidate who mingled with other Trump supporters outside the jail on Thursday morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judge Scott McAfee set a trial date of Oct. 23 for one of Trump's 18 co-defendants, attorney Kenneth Chesebro, after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proposed that date in response to Chesebro's request for a speedy trial. The judge's order said the schedule does not yet apply to Trump or any of the other defendants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleven of his co-defendants already have been booked, according to authorities. Some, like Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York mayor, were stone-faced in their mug shots, while others, such as lawyer Jenna Ellis, smiled for the camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All 19 defendants faced a Friday deadline to surrender. Court records showed that Mark Meadows, who served as Trump's White House chief of staff, was processed at the jail on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jail has a reputation for grim conditions that have inspired rap songs and prompted an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump faces 13 felony counts in the Georgia case, including racketeering, which is typically used to target organized crime, for pressuring state officials to reverse his election loss and setting up an illegitimate slate of electors to undermine the formal congressional certification of Biden's 2020 victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>TRIAL DATE WRANGLING</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Willis originally proposed a trial date of March 4 but moved it up for Chesebro after he asked that his trial start by October. Trump's legal team has yet to propose a date but is expected to push for a much later start. On Thursday, his newest Atlanta lawyer, Steven Sadow, asked for Trump to be tried separately from Chesebro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty in the three other cases and denied wrongdoing. In the Georgia case, Willis has requested that arraignments begin the week of Sept. 5, though defendants in Georgia are permitted to waive those appearances and plead not guilty via court filing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg filed the first case, accusing Trump of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to a porn star who claims to have had a sexual encounter with him years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also faces two sets of federal charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith - one case in Washington involving election interference and one in Miami involving classified documents he retained after leaving office in 2021. He faces 91 criminal counts in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump agreed to post $200,000 bond and accepted bail conditions that would bar him from threatening witnesses or his co-defendants in the Georgia case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives said on Thursday they would investigate whether Willis improperly coordinated with federal prosecutors. They previously launched an investigation of Bragg, who accused them of a \"campaign of intimidation.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday, Trump's leading rivals in the race for the Republican presidential nomination met in Milwaukee for their first debate. Trump skipped that event, instead sitting for a pre-taped interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson aimed at siphoning away viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I've been indicted four times - all trivial nonsense,\" Trump told Carlson.</p>\r\n",

The question was: Piyush Mishra's band Ballimaaraan refers to a locality in Delhi, most famously associated with which poet? The contestant chose Option D) Mirza Ghalib which was the correct answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big B then shared that a few lines giving reference of Ballimaaraan was used in his song 'Kajra Re' which also featured his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and son Abhishek Bachchan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said, \"Usmein hum teeno the. Tab Aishwarya humari bahu nahi thi, ab ban gayi hai. Gaane me bahu thi, Abhishek the aur hum the. Uss gaane mein bol the.\" Not only this, Amitabh Bachchan also requested the team to play Kajra Re as he grooved to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ABOUT KBC 15</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>'Kaun Banega Crorepati 15' airs from Monday to Friday at 9 pm on Sony TV.

This reaction followed the success of India's Chandrayaan 3 mission, which led to the journalist's criticism going viral and facing backlash for perceived racism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a video that is now going viral on X (formerly Twitter), Ali suggested that the journalist's surprise and jealousy were due to the fact that a former colony has significantly advanced in just 77 years. According to Ali, this rapid progress, especially in the field of space science, was hard for the journalist to digest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Gore bade pareshaan hai,” Ali can be heard saying in the video. “Hum ek dusre ko celebrate bhi karna jaante hai. Inhe burnol bheje, inhe phool bheje,” he added, hilariously as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take a look at the video:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<article>\r\n<div class=\"custom-media-docs\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"custom-video-iframe-cls multy-video-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" layout=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://embed.indiatoday.in/share/video/embed/9107\" title=\"\" width=\"648\"></iframe></div>\r\n</article>\r\n\r\n<p>The post has garnered a significant amount of views and is going viral swiftly.

He demanded back the 2.3 billion pounds that was “given to India as aid money”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 14, the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. After a successful journey, it landed near the lunar south pole on August 23.</p>\r\n",
