"short_desc": "US forces have destroyed over 80 one-way attack drones and six ballistic missiles launched from Iran and Yemen intended to strike Israel amid ongoing tensions in the region following Iran's unprecedented attack against Israel. In a retaliatory attack on Sunday, Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones directly towards Israel to avenge an airstrike on its consulate in Syria earlier this month that killed seven Revolutionary Guards and six Syrian civilians. The attack lasted for five hours and 99 per cent of drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel. The Israeli military said that it was on high alert and monitoring all targets.
